            The Company reserves the right to notify you of any increase in price before accepting your

             After a Confirmation Invoice has been issued, unless you choose to pay for your holiday in full at
                the time of booking, the price of your holiday is subject to the possibilities of surcharges in
                certain limited circumstances. However, a surcharge will only be levied to allow for variations in

                then, the Company will absorb an amount equal to 2% of your holiday price (excluding insurance
                premiums and amendment charges) before passing on any surcharge to you. Only amounts in excess of
                this 2% will be surcharged. Surcharges will be notified by a revised Confirmation Invoice sent to
                you.
            If a surcharge would increase the total holiday price shown on your original Confirmation Invoice
                by 10% or more, you may cancel your booking within 14 days of the date of issue of the revised
                Invoice and obtain a full refund of all payments made to the Company and any amendment charges
                previously incurred.
            Optionally, you may choose to pay for your holiday in full at the time of booking, in which case
                your holiday price will be fixed at the cost quoted by the Company at the time. To qualify for this
                benefit you should return the Confirmation Invoice to the Company with full payment to reach the
                Company within 7 days of the date printed on the Confirmation Invoice.
            The financial commitments offered above by the Company mean that the Company is not able to reduce
                the holiday prices should the value of the Omani Rial strengthen.</p>
      
        <h2>Cancellation and Changes by the Company</h2>
        <p>Occasionally it may be deemed necessary to make changes to your holiday and the Company reserves
            the right to do so at any time, and you will be notified of any changes at the earliest possible
            opportunity. If a major change to your tour is necessary, providing it does not arise from
            circumstances beyond the Company’s control, you may choose (i) to accept the change of arrangements
            (ii) to purchase another holiday from us or (iii) to cancel your holiday. Compensation may be
            payable in cases of major change as detailed below.
        No compensation will be payable for minor changes. Minor changes include minimal changes to
            departure and arrival times, changes to the type of aircraft used and restaurant and accommodation
            changes to a comparable or superior standard.
        Major changes include cancellation, changes to your UK airport, delays in departure or return by
            more than 12 hours and accommodation changes to an inferior standard of accommodation.
        Compensation will not be paid for changes or cancellations caused by Acts of God (Force Majeure),
            war, threat of war, riot, civil strike, industrial dispute, terrorist activity, natural or man-made
            disaster, fire, technical problems to transport, closure or congestion of airports, strikes or other
            industrial action, adverse weather conditions or any other event beyond the Company’s control. It is
            essential that you take out adequate travel insurance.
         The Company reserve the right to cancel your holiday at any time before the date of departure,
            even after a confirmation notice has been sent. If your holiday is cancelled the Company will refund
            in full the money you have already paid. No compensation will be payable.
         Transportation is subject to the conditions of carriage of the carrier, some of which may limit or
            exclude liability. These conditions are often the subject of international agreement between
            countries and copies of the conditions, which apply to your holiday journey, will normally be found
            on the carrier’s tickets.
         If you fail to pay the balance of the holiday price at least 30 days before departure, the Company
            will treat the booking as cancelled and levy the cancellation charges set out below
         The company also has the right to refuse any person as a member of the tour, if in their opinion
            that person could endanger the health, safety and enjoyment of others on the tour. In any of the
            events mentioned above, the company’s sole liability and the client’s sole remedy will be limited to
            a refund of any monies paid, less the amount for services already utilised plus administrative fees.
        
</p>

        <h2>Cancellation and Changes by You</h2>

            charges will be levied on any cancellation:

        8 – 15 days 80% of Tour Cost

            of amendments, though will be liable for any added cost this may add to the tour, including airline
            charges, hotels etc. Any further modifications, which are instigated by the client, will incur a
