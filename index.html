                <h1>TERMS & CONDITIONS</h1>

                <h2>1. Booking your Holiday</h2>
                <p>a) Your contract in respect of your holiday is made with Sugamyam Fine Destinations (‘the Company‘),
                    registered in Oman and all bookings are subject to these terms and conditions.</p>
                <p>b) All communications by the Company in relation to your holiday will be sent to the address stated
                    on the booking form.</p>
                <p>c) All bookings must be made through an authorised representative of the Company. At the time of
                    booking the Company booking form must be completed and submitted together with a deposit of 50% of
                    the total cost of the booking.</p>
                <p>d) Receipt of the deposit and booking form by the Company does neither guarantee nor imply
                    confirmation of the booking. No booking shall be confirmed until the Company issues a written
                    notice. The Company reserves the right to refuse a booking without giving any reason and shall in
                    that event return any deposit received.</p>
                <p>e) Your holiday must be paid in full at least 30 days before the departure date. If payment is not
                    received by the due date, the Company reserves the right to cancel the booking and retain the
                    deposit. The person who signs the booking form guarantees payment of the total amount shown on the
                    booking form in accordance with these conditions. It is the responsibility of the signatory to
                    ensure the Company receives payment in full by the due date. No reminders will be sent.</p>
                <p>f) If you book within 30 days of your departure date payment must be made in full at the time of
                    booking.</p>
                <p>g) All special requests, such as dietary requirements, should be noted on the booking form.</p>
                <p>h) The Company will provide the service as set out and confirmed in writing.</p>

                <h2>2. Price Policy</h2>
                <p>a) The Company is under no obligation to furnish a breakdown of the costs involved in a holiday.</p>
                <p>b) The Company reserves the right to notify you of any increase in price before accepting your
                    booking.</p>
                <p>c) After a Confirmation Invoice has been issued, unless you choose to pay for your holiday in full at
                    the time of booking, the price of your holiday is subject to the possibilities of surcharges in
                    certain limited circumstances. However, a surcharge will only be levied to allow for variations in
                    transportation cost, including cost of fuel, increase in normal published airfares, taxes or fees
                    chargeable for services such as landing taxes at airports, the exchange rate applied to the
                    particular package or if the government or regulatory body introduce an increase of taxes. Even
                    then, the Company will absorb an amount equal to 2% of your holiday price (excluding insurance
                    premiums and amendment charges) before passing on any surcharge to you. Only amounts in excess of
                    this 2% will be surcharged. Surcharges will be notified by a revised Confirmation Invoice sent to
                    you.</p>
                <p>d) If a surcharge would increase the total holiday price shown on your original Confirmation Invoice
                    by 10% or more, you may cancel your booking within 14 days of the date of issue of the revised
                    Invoice and obtain a full refund of all payments made to the Company and any amendment charges
                    previously incurred.</p>
                <p>e) Optionally, you may choose to pay for your holiday in full at the time of booking, in which case
                    your holiday price will be fixed at the cost quoted by the Company at the time. To qualify for this
                    benefit you should return the Confirmation Invoice to the Company with full payment to reach the
                    Company within 7 days of the date printed on the Confirmation Invoice.</p>
                <p>f) The financial commitments offered above by the Company mean that the Company is not able to reduce
                    the holiday prices should the value of the Omani Rial strengthen.</p>

                <h2>3. Cancellation and Changes by the Company</h2>
                <p>a) Occasionally it may be deemed necessary to make changes to your holiday and the Company reserves
                    the right to do so at any time, and you will be notified of any changes at the earliest possible
                    opportunity. If a major change to your tour is necessary, providing it does not arise from
                    circumstances beyond the Company’s control, you may choose (i) to accept the change of arrangements
                    (ii) to purchase another holiday from us or (iii) to cancel your holiday. Compensation may be
                    payable in cases of major change as detailed below.</p>
                <p>b) No compensation will be payable for minor changes. Minor changes include minimal changes to
                    departure and arrival times, changes to the type of aircraft used and restaurant and accommodation
                    changes to a comparable or superior standard.</p>
                <p>c) Major changes include cancellation, changes to your UK airport, delays in departure or return by
                    more than 12 hours and accommodation changes to an inferior standard of accommodation.</p>
                <p>d) Compensation will not be paid for changes or cancellations caused by Acts of God (Force Majeure),
